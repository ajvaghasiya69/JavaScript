    <h4>1. Can you provide a brief overview of the history of JavaScript and its significance in web development?</h4>
    <p><b>Ans.</b>

        1)JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally to JavaScript.
    2)In 1996, JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International for standardization.
    3)Libraries like jQuery, released in 2006, simplified DOM manipulation.
    4)Node.js, released in 2009, brought JavaScript to the server-side, allowing developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.
    5)ECMAScript 6 (ES6), published in 2015, introduced significant enhancements to the language, including arrow functions, classes, template literals, and more.

<h4>2. What are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript? </h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>1)Variables: Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.
2)Data Types: JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, functions, and more.
3)Operators: JavaScript includes operators for performing operations on variables and values. These include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and others.
4)Control Structures: JavaScript supports control structures like if statements, else statements, switch statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and more.
5)Functions: Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that can be defined and then called or invoked to perform a specific task</p>

<h4>3. Explain the basic syntax of JavaScript. </h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>1)Each statement typically ends with a semicolon ;
2)Single-line comments: These begin with // and continue until the end of the line.Multi-line comments: These are enclosed between /* and */ and can span multiple lines.

<h4>4. How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>1)Most programming languages are compiled, meaning that the code must be compiled into machine code before it can be run. On the other hand, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run  2)JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile-time.3) JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting within web browsers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Unlike server-side languages like Python or Java.</p>

<h4>5. What are the best practices to write clean and efficient JavaScript code?</h4>
<p><b>Ans.</b>1)Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to enhance code readability and maintainability.2)Minimize the use of global variables to prevent naming 3)Enable strict mode ('use strict';) to enforce cleaner syntax, catch common programming errors.4)Write a comments.</p>
